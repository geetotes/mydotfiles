My conf file repo. Stores:
* Streaming radio stations I listen to
* Unified bash colors and aliases

There is also some helpful stuff relating to GNU Screen:
* My screenrc config
* A helper script for overiding bash window titles

To run the autoinstaller, just execute the script from the directory you check the repo out into

Don't run the autoinstaller

JSLint is mean. Turn it off:
`JSLintToggle`
See errors in quick fix window:
`:copen`
`:cclose`
`:cn`

etc, etc,
https://github.com/hallettj/jslint.vim

Don't forget to toggle JSLint options at top of file:
i.e.:
````
/*jslint white: true, undef: true*/
````
