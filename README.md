My conf file repo. Stores:
* Streaming radio stations I listen to
* Unified bash colors and aliases

There is also some helpful stuff relating to GNU Screen:
* My screenrc config
* A helper script for overiding bash window titles

To run the autoinstaller, just execute the script from the directory you check the repo out into
